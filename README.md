## 📌 Problem Statement
Retail sales data is affected by trend, seasonality, and complex non-linear patterns.  
Single models often fail to capture all components effectively.

This project addresses the problem by combining:
- Trend & seasonality modeling
- Machine learning regression
- Hybrid ensemble forecasting

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Prophet-like Model
- Linear Regression for long-term trend
- Weekly seasonality extraction

### 2️⃣ Machine Learning Model
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Lag features and rolling averages

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Forecast
- Weighted combination of both models
- Improved stability and accuracy
